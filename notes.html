  <h2> Basics of HTML</h2>

<p><b>What is HTML?</b></p>
Hypertext Markup Language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, colour, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages.

<p><b>How the web works?</b></p>
A user enters a URL into a browser (for example, Google.com. This request is passed to a domain name server.The domain name server returns an IP address for the server that hosts the Website (for example, 68.178.157.132).The browser requests the page from the Web server using the IP address specified by the domain name server.The Web server returns the page to the IP address specified by the browser requesting the page. The page may also contain links to other files on the same server, such as images, which the browser will also request.The browser collects all the information and displays to your computer in the form of Web page.

<p><b>HTML Tags</b></p>
An element in HTML represents some kind of structure or semantics and generally consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. Below is one example :

<pre  class="code">
  <code><p>
    This is the content of paragraph or elements
  </p></code>
</pre>

<p><b>HTML Attributes</b></p>
An attribute defines a property for an element, consists of an attribute/value pair, and appears within the element's start tag. An element's start tag may contain any number of space separated attribute/value pairs.

<p><b>Document Section</b></p>
Another related term is "section". An HTML document is divided into a "head" section (the contents of the head element) and a "body" section (the contents of the body element).
